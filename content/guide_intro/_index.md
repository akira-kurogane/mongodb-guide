### Chapter 1

# What you can do with MongoDB

### Develop faster
Support more types of application
(flexible schemas; most drivers supported)

### Write faster, read faster
(the typical bottleneck is the I/O hardware, not computation)

### Go big
(sharding)

### Get bigger quickly 
(flexible sharding)

### Be small
(and save hardware spend)

### Get smaller quickly
(just kidding)

### Survive server, data center failures
Whenever (not If-ever) they occur

### Know the inside out
(because it's open source)
