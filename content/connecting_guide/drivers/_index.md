A library that an application can use, blah blah.

Drivers marshall data to and from the db server over the network, present an API that application can use, blah blah.

MongoDB has a lot of drivers. They're all different. They're all the same.

Differences: Language; datatypes (although a few are now basically C driver wrappers)

Same: Use the same Mongo Wire Protocol; pack and unpack BSON data; same server discovery rules; same replicaset failover rules; same connection URI; same db data operations offered
